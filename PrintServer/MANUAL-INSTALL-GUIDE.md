# Manual Installation Guide

If the batch files close too fast, follow these steps manually.

## Step-by-Step Manual Installation

### Step 1: Open Command Prompt as Administrator

1. Press `Win + X`
2. Select **"Windows Terminal (Admin)"** or **"Command Prompt (Admin)"**
3. Click **"Yes"** when asked for permission

### Step 2: Navigate to PrintServer Folder

```bash
cd "D:\Konain Bhai\Manpasand-Pos-\PrintServer"
```

### Step 3: Install node-windows (if not already installed)

```bash
npm install node-windows --save
```

*Note: You already have this installed, so you can skip this step.*

### Step 4: Install the Windows Service (RUN AS ADMINISTRATOR!)

**Important:** This step MUST be run as Administrator!

```bash
node install-service.js
```

**Expected output:**
```
âœ… Print Server service installed successfully!
ðŸ“‹ Service will start automatically on Windows boot
ðŸ”„ Service will auto-restart if it crashes or closes
```

### Step 5: Verify Service Exists

```bash
sc query "Manpasand Print Server"
```

**If service exists, you'll see:**
```
SERVICE_NAME: Manpasand Print Server
        TYPE               : 10  WIN32_OWN_PROCESS
        STATE              : 1  STOPPED  (or RUNNING)
        ...
```

**If service doesn't exist, you'll see:**
```
[SC] EnumQueryServicesStatus FAILED 1060:
The specified service does not exist as an installed service.
```

**If you get error 1060:**
- The service installation failed (not run as Admin)
- Re-run `node install-service.js` **as Administrator**

### Step 6: Set Startup Type to Automatic

```bash
sc config "Manpasand Print Server" start= auto
```

**Expected output:**
```
[SC] ChangeServiceConfig SUCCESS
```

**If you get error 1060:**
- Service doesn't exist yet
- Go back to Step 4 (run as Administrator)

### Step 7: Start the Service

```bash
sc start "Manpasand Print Server"
```

**Expected output:**
```
SERVICE_NAME: Manpasand Print Server
        TYPE               : 10  WIN32_OWN_PROCESS
        STATE              : 2  START_PENDING
                ...
```

**If you get error 1060:**
- Service doesn't exist
- Go back to Step 4 (run as Administrator)

### Step 8: Check Service Status

```bash
sc query "Manpasand Print Server"
```

**Look for:**
```
STATE              : 4  RUNNING
```

### Step 9: Test the Server

Open browser and go to:
- http://localhost:3001/health
- http://localhost:3001/printers

**Or test with curl:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/health
```

**Expected response:**
```json
{"status":"ok","printerInitialized":true,"timestamp":"..."}
```

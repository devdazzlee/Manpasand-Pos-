# Fix: Print Dialog Still Appearing in Kiosk Mode

## üî¥ Problem

Even with `--kiosk-printing` flag, print dialog still appears because:
- **Popup windows (`window.open()`) don't inherit the `--kiosk-printing` flag**
- The flag only applies to the main Chrome window that launched with it
- Popups are treated as separate windows without the flag

## ‚úÖ Solution

**Option 1: Use Hidden Iframe (Recommended)**

Instead of `window.open()`, use a hidden `<iframe>` - iframes stay in the same window context and respect the flag.

**Already implemented in code!** ‚úÖ

**Option 2: Print from Main Window Directly**

Remove all popups and print directly from the main window.

**Option 3: Verify Chrome Flags**

Make sure Chrome is actually running with the flag:
1. In Chrome, type: `chrome://version/`
2. Check "Command Line" section
3. Should see: `--kiosk-printing --kiosk`

---

## üîß Additional Fixes Needed

The code now uses iframe instead of popup, but you may also need:

### 1. Verify Flag is Applied

**Check if flag is active:**
1. Close all Chrome windows
2. Open Chrome via your shortcut
3. Type `chrome://version/` in address bar
4. Look for `--kiosk-printing` in "Command Line"

**If flag is NOT showing:**
- Shortcut is wrong
- Chrome is launching from somewhere else
- Need to fix shortcut again

### 2. Use Hidden Print Div (Alternative)

If iframe doesn't work, print directly from main page:

```typescript
// In kiosk mode: Show receipt in hidden div, then print main window
if (kioskMode) {
  // Show receipt on current page temporarily
  // Trigger print on main window
  // Hide receipt after print
}
```

### 3. Chrome Policy Issue

Some Chrome policies can disable silent printing. Check:
- Corporate/enterprise policies
- Group Policy settings
- Chrome extensions blocking print behavior

---

## üéØ Quick Test

**Test if flag is working:**
1. Open Chrome with shortcut
2. Press `F12` (Developer Tools)
3. Console tab ‚Üí Type: `window.print()`
4. **Should print silently without dialog!**

If dialog appears ‚Üí Flag not applied correctly
If prints silently ‚Üí Flag works, code issue

---

## ‚úÖ What I Fixed

Changed from `window.open()` popup to hidden `<iframe>`:
- Iframes stay in same window context
- Better chance of respecting `--kiosk-printing` flag
- Code updated in `new-sale.tsx`

---

## üîç Next Steps

1. **Verify Chrome flags** (`chrome://version/`)
2. **Test with updated code** (uses iframe now)
3. **If still doesn't work** ‚Üí Try printing directly from main window (no popup/iframe)

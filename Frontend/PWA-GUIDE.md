# Progressive Web App (PWA) Guide

## 🎉 Your MANPASAND POS is now a Progressive Web App!

This means users can install your POS system on their desktop or mobile devices just like a native app.

## ✨ Features

- 📱 **Install on Any Device**: Desktop (Windows, Mac, Linux) and Mobile (iOS, Android)
- 🚀 **Fast Loading**: Cached assets for instant loading
- 📡 **Offline Support**: Core functionality works without internet
- 🔔 **App-Like Experience**: Full screen, no browser UI
- 🔄 **Auto-Updates**: App updates automatically when online

## 🚀 How to Build & Deploy

### 1. Build the PWA

```bash
cd Frontend
yarn build
```

This will:
- Generate service workers
- Create optimized static files
- Bundle PWA assets in the `out` folder

### 2. Deploy

You can deploy the `out` folder to any static hosting service:

- **Netlify**: Drag & drop the `out` folder
- **Vercel**: Connect your GitHub repo
- **GitHub Pages**: Push `out` folder to gh-pages branch
- **Any Web Server**: Upload `out` folder contents

## 🔧 Testing the PWA

### Test Locally

```

### Test PWA Features

2. Go to the "Application" tab
3. Check:
   - **Manifest**: Verify your app info
   - **Service Workers**: Check if registered
   - **Storage**: View cached files
   - **Lighthouse**: Run PWA audit (score should be 90+)

## 📊 PWA Audit

Run a Lighthouse audit to check PWA quality:

1. Open Chrome DevTools
2. Go to "Lighthouse" tab
3. Select "Progressive Web App"
4. Click "Generate report"

You should see:
- ✅ Installable

## 🎨 Customization

### Change App Colors

Edit `Frontend/public/manifest.json`:

```json
{
  "theme_color": "#667eea",
  "background_color": "#ffffff"
}
```

### Change App Icons

Replace icons in `Frontend/public/icons/` with your own:
- icon-72x72.png
- icon-96x96.png
- icon-128x128.png
- icon-144x144.png
- icon-152x152.png
- icon-192x192.png
- icon-384x384.png
- icon-512x512.png

Or regenerate from your logo:

```bash
cd Frontend
node generate-pwa-icons.js
```

### Update App Name

Edit `Frontend/public/manifest.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "Your POS System Name",
  "short_name": "POS"
}
```

## 🔄 Updating the PWA

When you make changes:

1. Build the new version: `yarn build`
2. Deploy the `out` folder
3. Users will automatically get the update on next visit
4. Service worker will update in the background

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Install Button Not Showing

- Make sure you're using HTTPS (required for PWA)
- Check if service worker is registered in DevTools
- Verify manifest.json is accessible
- Clear browser cache and try again

### App Not Working Offline

- Check service worker is active in DevTools
- Verify files are being cached (Application > Cache Storage)
- Make sure you've visited the pages while online first

### iOS Issues

- iOS requires Safari for full PWA support
- Some features like push notifications don't work on iOS
- Users must use Safari's "Add to Home Screen"

## 📱 Development vs Production

### Development Mode

PWA is **disabled** in development (`yarn dev`) for easier debugging.

### Production Mode

PWA is **enabled** after building (`yarn build`).

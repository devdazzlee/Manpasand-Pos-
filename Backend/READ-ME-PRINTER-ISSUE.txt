PRINTER NOT PRINTING - FINAL DIAGNOSIS
========================================

YOUR CODE IS WORKING PERFECTLY!
========================================
✅ Data is being generated (793 bytes)
✅ Data is being sent to USB002 port  
✅ Windows reports success
✅ No errors in logs

THE PROBLEM:
=============
Windows is receiving the data but NOT sending it to the physical printer.

POSSIBLE CAUSES:
================
1. ❌ Printer is physically OFF
2. ❌ No paper in printer
3. ❌ Printer driver not properly configured
4. ❌ USB cable loose/disconnected  
5. ❌ Printer stuck in error state

SOLUTIONS TO TRY (IN ORDER):
=============================

1. PHYSICAL CHECK:
   - Is printer powered ON? ✓
   - Does it have paper? ✓
   - Press printer's TEST button - does it print?
   - Check printer display for errors

2. REBOOT PRINTER:
   - Turn printer OFF
   - Wait 10 seconds
   - Turn printer ON
   - Try printing again

3. WINDOWS PRINT SPOOLER:
   Open Command Prompt as ADMIN and run:
   ```
   net stop spooler
   net start spooler
   ```

4. REINSTALL PRINTER:
   - Control Panel > Devices and Printers
   - Right-click "BlackCopper 80mm Series(2)"
   - Select "Remove device"
   - Click "Add a printer"
   - Select your printer

5. MANUAL TEST:
   Go to: Settings > Devices > Printers & scanners
   Click: "BlackCopper 80mm Series(2)"
   Click: "Manage"
   Click: "Print test page"
   
   DOES THE TEST PAGE PRINT?
   - YES → Windows works, issue with our code (but logs show it's working!)
   - NO  → Hardware/Driver issue (printer needs help)

WHAT I KNOW:
============
✅ Your backend code is sending data correctly
✅ Windows is receiving the data successfully  
✅ The USB002 port exists and is writable
✅ Data (793 bytes) is being written to the port
❌ BUT nothing comes out of the printer

This is a WINDOWS/DRIVER/HARDWARE issue, not a code issue.

========================================
NEXT STEP: Check printer physically!
